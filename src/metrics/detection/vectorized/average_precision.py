        Vectorized Average Precision

    Notes
    -----
    Vectorized classification metrics are based on the vector representation of a line,
    that is, its representation as a pair of endpoints.
    Distance functions are used to determine if a line is True Positive.
    Further information can be found in papers [1]_ and [2]_.
    Each line should be represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2].
    Also, all lines must be scaled to the {1}x{1} resolution
    to eliminate the resolution factor affecting the distance threshold.
